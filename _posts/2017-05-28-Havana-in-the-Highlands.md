Many years ago when I lived in Switzerland I hosted a 'Havana in Happy Valley' Cuban themed dinner for friends and coworkers there.  Now I live in the 'Highlands' and hosting 'Havana in the Highlands' for family and a few close friends.  I've missed cooking and intend to do it more often.

Cooked some sautéed plantains last night as a test and made the black bean recipe I've had all these years today in advance of the party tomorrow.  They are delicious…
